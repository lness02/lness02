Hi, I’m Laura Ness! I'm a passionate, dedicated, and hard-working computer science and engineering major at UCLA. I'm involved in various clubs at UCLA, including ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) Studio and Cyber, as well as Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). I seek out every opportunity to learn something new, whether it be developing a mobile app SDK to developing games in Unity as part of a team in Game Jams. My leadership skills, sense of responsibility and loyalty, and positive demeanor make me a great team player.

Whether it be figuring out the cause of a bug in my code or pushing to complete project deadlines, I put my all into everything I do, and should I fail, I strive to do better. I want to create a better future by creating inspired and innovative technology that will impact many for years to come. 

Contact me if you want to collaborate with me on anything! I'd be happy to join.
