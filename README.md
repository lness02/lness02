Hello! I'm currently a 4th year Computer Science major at UCLA. I'm involved in various clubs at UCLA, including Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Studio and Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). I'm interested in data science, game development, and cybersecurity, though I'm open to trying anything software development-related. Whether it be leading a team to develop a rogue-like deck builder in Unity to learning mathematical principles behind cryptography, I want to learn more. Every project, whether individual or in a group, is a great learning opportunity, which is why I've sought out group projects in game jams, Student Run Studios (SRS), and hackathons. In putting what I've learned into practice, I want to create a better future by creating inspired and innovative technology that will impact many for years to come.
