Hi, I’m Laura Ness! I'm currently a second year at UCLA studying Computer Science. I'm also an officer for ACM Cyber and the event organizer for LA CTF.

I'm interested in cybersecurity and web development. I also sometimes participate in Game Jams. I basically just want to try anything and everything!

Contact me if you want to collaborate with me on anything! I'd be happy to join. 

Reach me at lness@ucla.edu
